# ipl_match_analysis
This is an IPL match analysis from 2008 to 2019. 

I have used pandas, matplotlib and searborn packages to read and visualise the data.

If you are in an intermediate level in Data Analysis, then this repository is for you.

I have used the dataset called "dataset.csv" to perform the following techniques:
* Data Visualisation
* Exploratory Data Analysis

You can have a look at ipl-match-analysis.ipynb file for more details.
